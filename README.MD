# zine idea generator 
Sometimes, I want to create a zine but struggle to find a topic. This project was my solution to that creative block.

## How It's made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

The project was inspired by a generator I stumbled upon that generates ideas for generators. I wanted to challenge myself and see if I could make one myself. It works by filling out a template string with random selections from each object, where every value is an array.

## Optimizations:
The project is not perfect; the text will bounce around. Needs to be fixed.
