# zine idea generator 
  Sometimes I want to create a zine but struggle to find a topicâ€”this project was my solution to that creative block. It taught me a lot about sentence construction and CSS and front end JavaScript, I had a blast     designing it.

## How It's made:

**Tech used:** html, css, javascript

  The project was inspired by this generator I stumbled across that generates ideas for generators. I wanted to challenge my self and see if I can make one myself.
  It works by filling out a template string with random selection from each of an object where every value is an array.

## Optimizations:
  The project is not prefect, the text will bounce around. need to fix that
